Authentic Early Medieval Ages Audio Pack: SETUP GUIDE

Dear Unity Developer,
Thank you for downloading this package and supporting my work!

Here are some indications as to how to use this pack.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
GENERAL REMARKS:

  The samples that work with the Unity "loop" function are located only in the "Ambient" and the "FX loopable" folders.  

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

1) 18 chimes to underline events

There are 18 chimes available for your game in the "Chimes" folder.  These are very short jingles that you can use when an event occurs like a victory, the acquisition of a new item etc.

2) Multiple ambiance sounds, all loopable

In the "Ambient" folder, you will find a variety of useful ambiance sounds that you can attach to any object, using the "loop" function in Unity.

3) As a bonus, over 206 medieval sound FX

I am mostly a music composer and by no means a specialist in special effects.  This is why I am offering these samples as a "bonus" and not as an "official" part of this package. 
They are a combination of my own recordings and various samplings from royalty free sources.  Therefore, there can be a big difference in the sound quality and "footprint".
What I mean by this is, it is very important to use the same microphone as often as possible when creating sound effects otherwise they will "sound" very different between samples, which does not always
sound very good. In future releases, if you believe that some of the sound FX I have produced are valuable, I will try to use my own mics to record as many sounds as possible instead of sampling royalty free
audio, so feel free to leave a comment with some suggestions! 
(PS: I know there is no female voice in the FX, but I don't really know any native enlish speaker in my country! :-P )

Please refer yourself to the videos I have put online to demo this pack as you can see how everything works!

I hope you'll be able to make use of this!
Don't forget to leave a review and suggestions/ideas for how to make this work even better!
I have purposefully created a variety of music/soundtrack solutions so that you can test them and provide me with feedback on the ones you prefer and would like me to enhance in future updates!

Thanks again for your support! 

sincerely,

Marma
